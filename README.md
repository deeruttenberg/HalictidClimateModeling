# HalictidClimateModeling

Attached is code used to generate the models for Ruttenberg et. al. 2022.  If you would like the code we used to visualize the results, please email dmr4@princeton.edu

## EMFigure2Final.R

This code generates the models in Figures 2a, 2b, and 2c.  Required inputs: seed (our paper uses seeds 1-50), and Days in Year (120 for 2a, 180 for 2b, {120,140,180} for 2c)

## EMCompDet.R

This code generates the models, and visualizations, in Figures 2a', 2b', and 2c'.  All parameters are hard coded, and all behaviors we examined are commented out.
