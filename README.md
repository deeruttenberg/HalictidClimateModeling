# HalictidClimateModeling

Attached is code used to generate the models for Ruttenberg et. al. 2023.  If you would like the code we used to visualize the results, please email dmr4@princeton.edu

## EusocialityModelEvolution.R

This code can be modified to generate Figures 2 and Supp Figures 1-3.  The parameters which vary between the figures are described in the comments. 

## EusocialityModelCompetition.R

This code can be modified to generate Figures 3 and Supp Figures 4-6.  The parameters which vary between the figures are described in the comments. 

## EMCompDet.R

This code generates the models, and visualizations, in Figures 2a', 2b', and 2c'.  All parameters are hard coded, and all behaviors we examined are commented out.  

## PlotClimateData.R and BritishDataAnalysis.R

This code analyzes the weater data for Figure 4a and 4b respectively.
