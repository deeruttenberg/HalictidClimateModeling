# What is This?

Attached is code used to generate the models for Ruttenberg et. al. 2024.  If you would like the code we used to visualize the results, please email dmr4@princeton.edu

## EusocialityModelEvolution.R

This code can be modified to generate Figures 2 and Supp Figures 1-4.  The parameters which vary between the figures are described in the comments. 

## EusocialityModelCompetition.R

This code can be modified to generate Figures 3 and Supp Figures 5-7.  The parameters which vary between the figures are described in the comments. 

## EMCompDet.R

This code generates the models, and visualizations, in Figures 2a', 2b', and 2c'.  All parameters are hard coded, and all suites of parameters we examined are commented out.  

## PlotClimateData.R and BritishDataAnalysis.R

This code analyzes the weater data for Figure 4a and 4b respectively, using the raw data ColoradoRawData.csv and UnitedKingdomRawData.csv respectively.
